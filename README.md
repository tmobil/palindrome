Palindrome problem


Assume valid words are available in a dictionary.
https://github.com/tmobil/palindrome/blob/master/english.json

Given valid words from the dictionary, find all pairs of the two valid words can be joined to form a palindrome.

For example, 
{bat, tab} 
{tab, bat}

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as words of differing character lengths, memory and performance considerations for the project.
