Palindrome problem


Assume valid words are available in a dictionary.
https://github.com/tmobil/palindrome/blob/master/english.json

Given valid words from the dictionary, find pairs of valid words can be joined to form a palindrome.

For example, the output should contain the following pairs.

{bat, tab} = {battab}

{bate, tab} = {batetab}

{tab, at} = {tabat}

{tab, bat} = {tabbat}

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as words of differing character lengths, memory and performance considerations for the project.
